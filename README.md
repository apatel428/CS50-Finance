This is a web application that allows users to virtually buy and sell stocks. Each user is given $10,000 in virtual cash and they are able to see their portfolio's total holdings, cash balances, and their transaction history. This web application uses real-time financial data by linking an API key provided by IEX Cloud:https://iexcloud.io/.
